# Full Cycle Course Repository

Hey there! Welcome to my Full Cycle course repository. I'm a senior software engineer always on the hunt for new knowledge, and right now, I'm digging into the nitty-gritty of software architecture, microservices development, and DevOps through the Full Cycle course.

This repo is where I archive the challenges I've undertaken as part of the course. Each challenge provides an opportunity to apply my technical skills and explore intriguing problems.

## Docker Course 
- [Go Challenge](./docker/go)
- [Nginx-Node Challenge](./docker/nginx-node)

As I tackle more challenges and deepen my knowledge, I'll keep this repository up to date. It's not just a showcase of my skills, but a chronicle of my learning journey in the tech world.

Feel free to dive into my solutions and check out the cool stuff I've been working on. Thanks for stopping by!
